// scheduled after `push ebx`, and the up term is loaded rather than copied from up_speed (one byte),
// so the three final sums land in the up registers where retail keeps them in the forward ones.
// Round 29: forward and up scaled into their own vectors with left scaled straight into velocity,
// then two vector3f_add, 76 -> 30 (kept). On it (fast): shared cross3f/cross3f_staged 30/30; forward
// and up pointer locals 135; forward scaled before the cross product 28 (forward_speed leaves xmm6,
// all three callers stop matching); left scaled first 82; up scaled before left 79; vector3f_scale
// for each part 30/30/30; operands of the last add swapped 30; first sum before the up scaling 85,
// with forward first 91; sums accumulated in forward_part 30. Earlier forms, on the old body:
// Round 81 (score 76): `forward`/`up` pointer locals for the cross product
// alone 74 (retail's product operand order); velocity written directly without the
// scaled copy 80 (retail's 0xc frame); left_part/up_part vectors 79-83; left scaled in
// place 83; velocity = left * left_speed first 85-87 (forward_speed leaves xmm6)
// Round 197 fast trials: Existing cross helper with up/forward/both scalar inputs, output
// last/first and actual vector return 84, 72, 95, 83, 72, 95, 156, 153.
// Forward scalar inputs with up by pointer: 72 with output first or last; four-point lead reverted.
// Round 77 (plain): the scale/add/add helper chain straight into velocity 84 (0xc frame, but each
// sum commutes: retail accumulates in the forward product's register); chain into the working
// vector with the last step writing velocity 86; per-component three-term sums 93 and through
// vector3f_assign 93 (both need the two helpers as plain definitions, which 0x1c1e70 accepts);
// forward and left summed per component, up through add-scaled 93. Retail stores nothing of
// velocity until all three sums are done and loads up.j early (xmm7), spilling two left products.
// Round 9 (fast): `forward`/`up` pointer locals for every read 75 (378 bytes); those with velocity
// written directly 84 (0xc frame and retail's cross-product operand order, but velocity is
// stored component by component as each sum finishes, where retail stores all three at the end);
// forward scaled into the working vector, left scaled into velocity and the two added with
// vector3f_add, then up added in place, with/without the pointers 84/83; `velocity = scaled;`
// 83, with the pointers 82.
// Round 35 screen (cross helper: file-local / shared cross3f / forward and up pointer locals /
// cross3f_staged, x velocity: current / scale-add-add chain / per-component sums / left scaled first
// then add-scaled forward and up / left scaled first then per-component sums): current velocity with
// the pointer locals or the staged cross 75 (378/379 bytes); every other velocity form drops retail's
// two spills (353-362 bytes) and scores 84-98.
// Round 102 (fast): scale(left) into velocity then add_scaled(forward) and add_scaled(up) 87 (the cross
// product orders, the 0xc frame and the magnitude tail match, but forward_speed moves to XMM4 and nothing
// spills); scale(forward) then add_scaled(left) and add_scaled(up) 84; the cross product straight into
// velocity, scaled in place, then forward and up 83; the j/k/i form straight into velocity 80; velocity
// declared before left with the left-first chain 87.
// Round 232: Completed-vector memcpy / native component loop crossed with original / staged cross and native / helper left addition
// 83, 76, 82, 75, 83, 78, 83, 78. Original executable source restored.
