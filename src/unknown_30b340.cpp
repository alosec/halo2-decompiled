// fields out of offset order (+0x14 and +0x18 before +0x10, +0x24 before +0x1c),
// and the list's own stores last of all; the compiler emits the member stores
// in declaration order whatever order the initializer list is in, and a list
// with a constructor is built before the body, so retail's order needs the
// header's list to be a plain member, which is out of scope
// tried and no better: the initializer list in retail's store order (the same
// bytes), the stores in the body instead of the initializer list (16: the base
// class's stores then come first as in retail, but the list's own stores move
// ahead of the fields), the list's fields assigned in the body as well (44: the
// list's constructor's stores are not eliminated as dead, so they appear
// twice)
